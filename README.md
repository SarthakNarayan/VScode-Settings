# VScode-Settings
These are the VSCode settings that I use. 
settings_global refers to the global settings

In addition to that we might need local settings specially for removing linting and other stuff to ensure this just copy .vscode folder in your working directory.
Any changes you make to settings.json inside the .vscode directory will affect that workspace or folder settings only.

To refer to shortcuts while working with VSCode you can use the extension VSCode Daily Notes and paste the daily_notes.md file in it and view it whenever you want by searching **Open Daily notes** in the command palette
