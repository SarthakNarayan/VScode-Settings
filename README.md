# VScode-Settings
These are the VSCode settings that I use. 
settings_global refers to the global settings

In addition to that we might need local settings specially for removing linting and other stuff to ensure this just copy .vscode folder in your working directory.
Any changes you make to settings.json inside the .vscode directory will affect that workspace or folder settings only.
